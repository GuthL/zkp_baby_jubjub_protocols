# zkp_baby_jubjub_protocols
This repository contains a work-in-progress. The first protocol is a Zero Knowledge Proof of key ownership for Baby Jubjub inside a ZkSnark using ZoKrates.

To download an Python implementation of baby_jubjub ECC operations, you can download the repository from BarryWhiteHat: https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/baby_jubjub_ecc and run the code available in the test/ folder. 

In test_mul.py, you can choose for a specific k and generator G and get the resulting point P = kG.

Work-in-progress: a proof of knowledge of a/multiple private Merkle Tree paths.
